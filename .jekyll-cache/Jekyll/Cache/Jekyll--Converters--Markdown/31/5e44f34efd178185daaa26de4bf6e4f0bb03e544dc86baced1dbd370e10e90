I"ì<p>Home they brought her warrior dead:<br />
She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:<br />
All her maidens, watching, said,<br />
â€˜She must weep or she will die.â€™</p>

<p>Then they praised him, soft and low,<br />
Called him worthy to be loved,<br />
Truest friend and noblest foe;<br />
Yet she neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p>Stole a maiden from her place,<br />
Lightly to the warrior stept,<br />
Took the face-cloth from the face;<br />
Yet she neither moved nor wept.</p>

<p>Rose a nurse of ninety years,<br />
Set his child upon her kneeâ€”<br />
Like summer tempest came her tearsâ€”<br />
â€˜Sweet my child, I live for thee.â€™</p>
