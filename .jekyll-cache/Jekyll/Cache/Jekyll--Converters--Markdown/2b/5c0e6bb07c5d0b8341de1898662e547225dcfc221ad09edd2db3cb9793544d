I"ù<p>â€œBut if he is innocent, who has done it?â€</p>

<p>â€œAh! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry â€˜Cooee!â€™ before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all minor matters until to-morrow.â€</p>

<p>There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright and cloudless. At nine oâ€™clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool.</p>

<p>â€œThere is serious news this morning,â€ Lestrade observed. â€œIt is said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.â€</p>

<p>â€œAn elderly man, I presume?â€ said Holmes.</p>

<p>â€œAbout sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend of McCarthyâ€™s, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.â€</p>

<p>â€œIndeed! That is interesting,â€ said Holmes.</p>

<p>â€œOh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him.â€</p>
