I"µ<p>Visible, invisible,<br />
A fluctuating charm,<br />
An amber-colored amethyst<br />
Inhabits it; your arm<br />
Approaches, and<br />
It opens and<br />
It closes;<br />
You have meant<br />
To catch it,<br />
And it shrivels;<br />
You abandon<br />
Your intentâ€”<br />
It opens, and it<br />
Closes and you<br />
Reach for itâ€”<br />
The blue<br />
Surrounding it<br />
Grows cloudy, and<br />
It floats away<br />
From you.</p>
