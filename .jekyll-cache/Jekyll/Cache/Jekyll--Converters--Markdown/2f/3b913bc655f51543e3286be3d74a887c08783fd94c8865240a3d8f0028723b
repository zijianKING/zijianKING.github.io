I"…<p>â€œMy will? Yes, certainly, I know that,â€ said the doctor, a trifle sharply. â€œYou have told me so.â€</p>

<p>â€œWell, I tell you so again,â€ continued the lawyer. â€œI have been learning something of young Hyde.â€</p>

<p>The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. â€œI do not care to hear more,â€ said he. â€œThis is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop.â€</p>

<p>â€œWhat I heard was abominable,â€ said Utterson.</p>

<p>â€œIt can make no change. You do not understand my position,â€ returned the doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. â€œI am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strangeâ€“a very strange one. It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.â€</p>

<p>â€œJekyll,â€ said Utterson, â€œyou know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you out of it.â€</p>

<p>â€œMy good Utterson,â€ said the doctor, â€œthis is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isnâ€™t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.â€</p>

<p>Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.</p>
